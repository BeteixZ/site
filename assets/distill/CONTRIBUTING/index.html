<h1>How to Contribute</h1>
<p>We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.</p>
<h2>Contributor License Agreement</h2>
<p>Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/">https://cla.developers.google.com/</a> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.</p>
<p>You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.</p>
<h2>Code reviews</h2>
<p>All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">GitHub Help</a> for more
information on using pull requests.</p>
<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
<p>This project follows
<a href="https://opensource.google/conduct/">Google's Open Source Community Guidelines</a>.</p>
