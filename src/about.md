# About Me

<div class="about-section">
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I'm a mathematics PhD with a passion for solving complex problems. My current research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to solve partial differential equations, bridging the gap between traditional mathematical methods and modern computational approaches.</p>

<div class="about-section">
  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>Beyond mathematics, I'm deeply interested in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Music</strong> - From Art Pop to indie, I enjoy diverse genres</li>
    <li><strong>Astronomy</strong> - Fascinated by the cosmos and its overwhelming elegance</li>
    <li><strong>Global Climate Systems</strong> - Studying the complex dynamics of our planet's climate</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>This Site</h2>
  <p>I used to maintain a WordPress website at <a href="https://bindow.top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bindow.top</a>, but found it unnecessarily complex and resource-intensive. This site is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty</a>, a simpler and more lightweight static site generator.</p>
  
  <p>The design is intentionally minimal, focusing on content and readability while maintaining a distinct aesthetic that reflects my appreciation for clean, functional design.</p>
